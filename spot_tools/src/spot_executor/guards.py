"""Runtime-guard extraction from a bosdyn RobotState snapshot (PR B8).

Pure proto -> dict, deliberately defensive: the sim's RobotState carries only
kinematic/manipulator state (no battery/power/estop sub-messages), and a real
Spot's snapshot can omit fields transiently — every guard therefore reports a
``*_known`` flag alongside its value, and the consumer decides what an
unknown means (the planner's dispatch gate fails OPEN on unknown, with a
warning: a missing guard stream must not brick planning).
